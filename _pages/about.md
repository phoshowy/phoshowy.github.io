### I am currently a second-year graduate student at the Xiamen University Institute of Artificial Intelligence, focusing on research in neural network robustness, particularly adversarial purification.

### I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology from the School of Computer Science and Big Data at Fuzhou University. I am now pursuing my master's degree at the Intelligent Multimedia Laboratory at Xiamen University under the guidance of Associate Professor [Zhiming Luo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RdRCIIYAAAAJ&hl=en).

  <b>Contributions</b>
  <ul>
    <li>We further reveal distributional differences between adversarial and clean samples in the magnitude spectrum.</li>
    <li>The proposed MANI-Pure framework combines magnitude-adaptive diffusion with frequency-domain purification, achieving a principled balance between semantic fidelity and perturbation mitigation.</li>
    <li>Extensive experiments across datasets, attacks, and backbones demonstrate the superiority of our method.</li>
  </ul>
