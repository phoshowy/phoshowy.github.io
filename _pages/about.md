I am currently a second-year graduate student at the Xiamen University Institute of Artificial Intelligence, focusing on research in neural network robustness, particularly adversarial purification.

I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology from the School of Computer Science and Big Data at Fuzhou University. I am now pursuing my master's degree at the Intelligent Multimedia Laboratory at Xiamen University under the guidance of Associate Professor [Zhiming Luo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RdRCIIYAAAAJ&hl=en).

[MANI-Pure: Magnitude-Adaptive Noise Injection for Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25082)

**Xiaoyi Huang**, Junwei Wu, Kejia Zhang, Carl Yang, Zhiming Luo

**Contributions**
- We empirically verify that adversarial perturbations are concentrated in high-frequency bands and further reveal distributional differences between adversarial and clean samples in the magnitude spectrum.
- The proposed MANI-Pure framework combines magnitude-adaptive diffusion with frequency-domain purification, achieving a principled balance between semantic fidelity and perturbation mitigation, reflected in improvements to both clean and robust accuracy.
- Extensive experiments across datasets, attacks, and backbones demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of robustness, clean accuracy and perceptual quality, as well as its scalability as a plug-and-play module.
